# How to consult Mind maps

All .mm files in src folder are [Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) that can be edited with [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net) 1.0.1. They can also be imported in [WiseMapping](http://wisemapping.com/) and probably with other tools.
All files have been exported as a png image for a quick view using a simple image viewer.

# Goal

These mindmaps are here to give a quick overview of features. For a tester it's a good way to sort out test ideas. It is also a simple way to gather
informations about the state of the product and avoid big boring documentation. Of course, these maps will have to be updated regularly in order to be up-to-date.
