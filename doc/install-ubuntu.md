Installation on Ubuntu
-------------------------

This manual will guide you through the system-wide installation process of elasticsearch, mongodb and nodeJS on Linux/ubuntu

See also [General installation instructions](https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/projects/OR/repos/rse/browse/README.md)

1. Open a terminal and install git

        sudo apt-get install git

2. clone the repository

        git clone https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/scm/or/rse.git

3. Install ElasticSearch 1.3.5
 Download and install ElasticSearch 1.3.5 [deb package](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-1-3-5) from elastic website

        wget https://download.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.3.5.deb
        sudo dpkg -i elasticsearch-1.3.5.deb

 Pin the version to avoid unwanted updates

        echo "elasticsearch hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections

 Create a symlink to your elastic search bin somewhere in your path if this was not done during the previous step (alternatively, you can add /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/ to your path)

        sudo ln -s /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch /usr/bin/elasticsearch

 If you have other ElasticSearch instance in the same sub-network running with the same cluster name than yours (default configuration), you may need to disable multicast discovery otherwise it will break the mongo river.
 For that uncomment the following line in /etc/ElasticSearch/elasticsearch.yml: 

    discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false

 **Only the elasticsearch user should be able to install plugins**
Elasticsearch plugin dir may have not been created during the installation, or may have been given ownership to root. [This was a bug](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/8419)

        sudo mkdir /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins
        sudo chown elasticsearch:elasticsearch /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/elasticsearch/plugins

 **Config dir may have not been created (when in a sysV system)**

        sudo ln -s /etc/elasticsearch /usr/share/elasticsearch/config

4. Install MongoDB 2.6.5 from the mongoDB repositories [instructions](http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.6/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

  Import GPG key

        sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10

  Create list file for mongoDB

        echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list

  Update apt cache

        sudo apt-get update

  Install mongoDB 2.6.5

        sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org=2.6.5 mongodb-org-server=2.6.5 mongodb-org-shell=2.6.5 mongodb-org-mongos=2.6.5 mongodb-org-tools=2.6.5

  Pin current version to avoid updates (lastest version in this repository is 2.6.9 but this may vary)

        echo "mongodb-org hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
        echo "mongodb-org-server hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
        echo "mongodb-org-shell hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
        echo "mongodb-org-mongos hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
        echo "mongodb-org-tools hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections

5. Retrieve rse-scripts
        git clone https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/scm/or/rse-scripts.git

 Run the scripts (java and curl are needed)

        sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk curl

 Specify the path to ElasticSearch plugin and run the first script (as elasticsearch user):

        sudo -u elasticsearch bash
        export ES_BIN_PLUGIN=/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin
        ./1_elasticsearch_river_install.sh

 Start elasticsearch and run the second script (as your regular sudoer user)
        
        sudo service elasticsearch start
 or
 
        sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch -Des.pidfile=$PID_DIR/elasticsearch.pid -Des.default.path.home=$ES_HOME -Des.default.path.logs=$LOG_DIR -Des.default.path.data=$DATA_DIR -Des.default.config=$CONF_FILE -Des.default.path.conf=$CONF_DIR

 Wait until elasticsearch is up

        ./2_config_elasticsearch_analyser.sh
        contacts/init.sh

 Before running step 3, you must configure MongoDB cluster in replica set. Open `/etc/mongod.conf` and modify replSet

        replSet=rs
        
 Then restart MongoDB

        service mongod restart

 This may fail **in ubuntu 15.04** and you may need to start it as `mongod --replSet=rs`

 Change the hostname of the machine to 127.0.0.1 (**this will break communication between your terminal and X**)

        hostname 127.0.0.1

 Open the mongo shell (with `mongo`) and launch

        > rs.initiate()

 About a minute later, you will have a PRIMARY prompt that will appear when checking the status of MongoDB

        > rs.status()
        
 Then continue with 3rd script (when the cluster is running as a PRIMARY node)

        3_config_elasticsearch_mongodb_river.sh

 **After successfully running this script, you can restore your hostname**

 If you missed something during the previous steps, a script `delete_elasticsearch_mongodb_river.sh` is available. After using it, please go back to step 2 again.

6. Install node.js

 Please note that your version of node.js must be greater than version 0.10.28 but less than or equal to 0.10.36. We highly recommend that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install a specific version of node.

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.11.1/install.sh | bash

 You will have to reopen your terminal or run source ~/.profile

        nvm install 0.10.36

 Usually, nvm will switch to use the most recently installed version. You can explicitly tell nvm to use the version we just downloaded by typing:

        nvm use 0.10.36

 For a system-wide install, run this command now and **any time you change your node version**

        n=$(which node);n=${n%/bin/node}; chmod -R 755 $n/bin/*; sudo cp -r $n/{bin,lib,share} /usr/local

7. You may need some additional packages.

        sudo apt-get install build-essential redis-server python-setuptools graphicsmagick graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev

8. Install the npm dependencies

        sudo npm install -g mocha grunt-cli bower karma-cli #node-gyp
    
9. Install the gjslint dependency

        sudo easy_install http://closure-linter.googlecode.com/files/closure_linter-latest.tar.gz

    more informations [can be found here](https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto)
    
10. Go into the project directory and install project dependencies (not as an administrator)

        cd rse
        npm install

 This may fail with EACCESS and you may need to remove ~/.npm and repeat step 10

If you have any problem relating to `node-canvas` during the dependencies installation,
make sure your system has installed [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/). Documentation [can be found here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas).

11. Install Sabre/dav

Follow [sabre installation instructions](https://ci.open-paas.org/stash/projects/OR/repos/esn-sabre/browse/README.md).

Testing
-------

You can check that everything works by launching the test suite:

    grunt

If you want to launch tests from a single test, you can specify the file as command line argument.
For example, you can launch the backend tests on the test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js file like this:

    grunt test-unit-backend --test=test/unit-backend/webserver/index.js

Note: This works for backend and midway tests.

Some specialized Grunt tasks are available :

    grunt linters # launch hinter and linter against the codebase
    grunt test-frontend # only run the fontend unit tests
    grunt test-unit-backend # only run the unit backend tests
    grunt test-midway-backend # only run the midway backend tests
    grunt test # launch all the testsuite

Fixtures
--------

Fixtures can be configured in the fixtures folder and injected in the system using grunt:

    grunt fixtures
