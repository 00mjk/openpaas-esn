# Hidden URLs

There are some hidden URLs in OpenPaas.
Such URLs are not directly accessible via a button or a link in the web interface,
but still present in the system and can be displayed if typed directly in the browser's address bar.

All links in the following list are relative to the OpenPaas base URL: https://openpaas.host/#/.
