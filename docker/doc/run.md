# Howto use ESN with Docker

The RSE can be used with Docker to ease the deployment of all the required components:

- Redis
- MongoDB
- Apache Cassandra
- Apache James
- Elastic Search
- Sabre DAV
- OpenPaaS ESN

Note: All the docker related instructions below has been tested with docker-compose 1.6.0 and docker 1.10.0.
Please check [docker.com](http://docker.com) for installation instructions.

## Howto Launch OpenPaaS

### With docker-compose

docker-compose is the simplest way to run a distributed application, so you can launch the OpenPaaS platform in a single command.

There are two ways to run the OpenPaaS platform with docker-compose:

1. Build required containers yourself from sources.
2. Run from Docker Hub containers which are available from https://hub.docker.com/u/linagora/

**Build required containers yourself from sources**

The default docker-compose descriptor can be found at the root or the current repository (check the docker-compose.yml file).

You have to build the ESN container before to launch OpenPaaS. Go to the top repository folder then:

```
docker-compose -f ./docker/dockerfiles/platform/docker-compose.yml build
```

Note: If your have an error saying that the linagora/esn-base can not be found, you have to build it before. Refer to the 'dev' section below in this case.

Then you can run:

``` sh
PROVISION=true DOCKER_IP=<YOUR_DOCKER_IP> docker-compose -f ./docker/dockerfiles/platform/docker-compose.yml up
```

**Run from Docker Hub containers (ie build nothing)**

```bash
PROVISION=true DOCKER_IP=<YOUR_DOCKER_IP> docker-compose -f ./docker/dockerfiles/platform/docker-compose-images.yml up
```

In both cases, environment variables are defined like:

- PROVISION (Required on first launch only): Tell OpenPaaS to initialize configuration and provision some users/domains/communities so that once launched, you can log in into OpenPaaS.
- DOCKER_IP: localhost (or 127.0.0.1) on Linux-based system or the docker-machine IP on OS X and Windows (default machine is accessible at 192.168.99.100, type 'docker-machine ip default' to check the value). It is required to set this IP so that the configuration is generated from the right value. If not set, the webserver may not provide some assets correctly.

Launching the platform may take some time (1-2 minutes), grab a coffee and be ready for the next steps!

There are still some things to configure to have a fully operational platform. Let's create required resources on the James Mail Server:

- Add a Domain:

```bash
docker exec esn_james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h localhost adddomain open-paas.org
```

- To create an user:

```bash
docker exec esn_james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h localhost adduser admin@open-paas.org james
```

To check that the user is well created, you can telnet on the James IMAP port:

```
telnet <YOUR_DOCKER_IP> 1143
```

and login with:

```
A0 LOGIN admin@open-paas.org james
```

The server should print some logs in the docker-compose console and send you back a login completed message:

```
A0 OK LOGIN completed.
```

You should now be able to use several services (check the docker-compose.yml file to find the list or exposed ports).
Let's connect to the OpenPaaS Web appliction on http://<YOUR_DOCKER_IP>:8080. If you launched docker-compose with the PROVISION variable set to true, you can log in with

```
username: admin@open-paas.org
password: secret
```

You can check the [./mailer.md](./mailer.md) documentation to look how to configure a Mail client to access to the OpenPaaS mail server.

### Known Issues

- **James not started**. It is possible that the James server exits on launch if some of its dependencies are not fully started. You can then relaunch the James server with the following command:

```
docker-compose restart james
```

Note that this will not append the container logs to the main docker-compose logs, so you can get them by running 'docker-compose logs -f esn_james'

- **http://<YOUR_DOCKER_IP>:8080 unreachable**. The ESN to MongoDB connection may fail in some condition. Try to relaunch the ESN service:

```
docker-compose restart esn
```

- **Data is not provisioned**

They may have some database connection timeout at startup and so no user is available and you can not connect to the application.
Try to relaunch the ESN service:

```
docker-compose restart esn
```

If it still does not work, restart all the services.

- **Elasticsearch errors**

If you have an error like:

```
wait-for-it.sh: timeout occurred after waiting 30 seconds for localhost:9200
```

It means that your docker-compose platform is quite slow. You can increase the timeout value by setting the ELASTICSEARCH_INIT_TIMEOUT environment variable.

```
ELASTICSEARCH_INIT_TIMEOUT=120 docker-compose ...
```

- **OutOfMemoryError** when launching james. It is possible that docker is not well configured on some distributions with systemd.

Try:

```
systemctl status docker.service
‚óè docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2016-03-02 11:22:38 CET; 4min 30s ago
     Docs: https://docs.docker.com
 Main PID: 18869 (docker)
    Tasks: 312 (512)
   CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
```

Note the Tasks line, the 512 limit is not enough for us.

To change the settings find the docker.service systemd conf. For me it is:

```
vim /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service
```

Then add the line **TasksMax=infinity** under **[Service]**.
Now restart:

```
systemctl restart docker.service
```

You may have to also run (if you are asked to):

```
systemctl daemon-reload
```

# Dev

All the OpenPaaS Dockerfiles and docker-compose descriptor heavily use environment variables to create required resources such as configuration files, endpoints, etc...
This allows us to easily configure them when containers are launched, will it be from docker, docker-compose or any other high level abstraction.
